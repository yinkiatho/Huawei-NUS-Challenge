# Huawei-NUS-Challenge
Huawei-NUS Innovation Challenge

The Huawei-NUS Innovation Challenge requires participants to build a trading model based on historical transaction data and complete a trading task by selecting optimal time points to trade within the given trading time. Participants will be provided with a basket of stocks to buy and sell, and the model should buy in at the lowest possible price and sell out at the highest price during the transaction period. The objective of the competition is to establish a stock timing model that finds the best trading opportunities while striving for the lowest overall trading cost of the stock. The trading models will be evaluated against real stock market data.
